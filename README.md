# csharp-events

### Events
Provide notifications and send data through EventArgs

### Delegates
- Act as pipeline between events and event handlers
- A "function pointer"
- Moves data from point A to a handler method
- Inherits from MulticastDelegate which allows invoking multiple subscribers (InvocationList)
- In an invocation list, the value is returned for the last delegate

### Event Handlers
Receive and process EventArg data
